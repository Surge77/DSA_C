/*

There is no such thing as which is better Linked list or array..
One can be good in a particular requirement and other can be good in another kind of requirement, it all depends on factors like 
what is the most frequent operation you want to do on data structure, or what is the size of the data.....

Arrays: 

Cost of accessing a element: O(1) constant time

Memory requirements: Fixed size , unused memory , memory may not be available as one large block

Cost of inserting an element: 1. At beginning: O(n) , 2. At end : O(1) 3. At middle or ith position: O(n) time complexities for deleting will also be same

Ease of use: Easy to use



Linked List:

Cost of accessing a element: O(n) 

Memory requirements: no unused memory, extra memory for pointer variables, memory may be available as multiple small blocks

Cost of inserting an element: 1. At beginning: O(1) , 2. At end : O(n) , 3. At middle or ith position: O(n) time complexities for deleting will also be same

Ease of use : A bit difficult than arrays, more prone to errors like segmentation fault and memory leaks


Types of Linked List:

1.Singly Linked List
2.Doubly Linked List
3.Circular LL
4.Doubly Circular LL

WE CAN DO SOME MODIFICATION AND CREATE OUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION OF LINKED LIST
