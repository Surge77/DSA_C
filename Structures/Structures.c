//Problems with arrays?
//we can't store mixed type data within arrays as follows
/*

Structure is an collection of data items of different Data Types

why strucuture?
-structure is a powerful concept that we will use in programs
-it is a convenient tool for handling a group of real time data such as:
Name,Age,Ph,No,USN
-it help us to organize complex data

Arrays:
-are used only to store collection of same datatypes
-derived datatype
-act just like a variable,and its simple

structures:
-structures are used to store collection of different datatypes
-designed by us
-complicated and first designed and then use it.

-Defining a structure:

SYNTAX:

struct tag_name{

    datatype member1;
    datatype member2;
    ....
    ....
    datatype membern;
};

1."struct" is a C keyword used to define a structure
2."tag_name" is the name of the structure given by us
3.Variables declared inside a structure is called as structure members

Example:

struct personinfo{

    char name[10];
    int age;
    float percentage;

};
