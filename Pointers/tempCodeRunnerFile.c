 // int a = 100; // we are not touching this variable , with pointers alone we are getting the value and address of the variable
    // int *p1 = &a;
    // int **p2 = &p1; // (p2 -> p1 -> a) chain of pointers 
    // //with **p2 pointer we can access the p1 as well as A

    // printf("the value of A using *p1 : %d\n",*p1);

    // printf("the address of A using **p2 : %d\n",(int)*p2); //since an address can be in any form whether decimal,hexadecimal..we need to typecast

    // printf("the value of A using **p2 : %d\n",**p2);
