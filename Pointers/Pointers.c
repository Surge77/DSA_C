//2.pointer reduces the length and complexity of a program
//3.pointer is used for dynamic memory allocation
//4.pointer is more efficient in handling huge data(arrays)
//5.Pointer is most powerful and efficient tool in C

//Declaration of pointer

//syntax:

//datatype *pointer_name;  =>style 1
//datatype* pointer_name;  =>style 2
